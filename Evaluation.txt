The project involves creating and configuring a virtual machine following strict rules. 
The evaluated person will need to assist you during the defense. 
Make sure all the following points are respected.

General Guidelines:

  During the defense, as soon as you need help to verify a point, the evaluated person must assist you:
    1. As a precaution, you may duplicate the original virtual machine to keep a copy.
    2. Check that the "signature.txt" file is present at the root of the cloned repository.
    3. Ensure that the signature contained in "signature.txt" matches that of the ".vdi" file of the virtual machine being evaluated.
    A simple diff should allow you to compare the two signatures. If needed, ask the evaluated person where their ".vdi" file is located.
      Path: 
        /home/migusant/sgoinfre/Born2beroot/Born2beroot.vdi
      Diff Command: 
        diff <(sha1sum /home/migusant/sgoinfre/Born2beroot/Born2beroot.vdi | cut -d' ' -f1) <(cat signature.txt)
      Diff Output:
        If the signatures match, the diff command will produce no output.
        If the signatures do not match, diff will show the lines that differ (i.e., the two different hashes).
    4. Launch the cloned virtual machine to be evaluated.
  If something does not work as expected or the two signatures differ, the evaluation stops here.

Project Overview:

  The evaluated person must simply explain:
    1. The basic functioning of their virtual machine.
      "My virtual machine runs using VirtualBox on my host computer. The hypervisor creates a simulated hardware environment by allocating 
      resources like CPU cores, RAM, and disk space from the host machine. Inside this isolated environment, I have installed and configured 
      the Debian operating system. It functions like a separate computer, but it's entirely contained within the hypervisor software on my host."
    2. Their choice of operating system.
      "I chose Debian primarily because it's the required operating system for the Born2beroot project at 42. Additionally, Debian is well-regarded 
      for its stability, extensive software repositories managed by apt, strong security focus, and its widespread use in server environments. This 
      makes it an excellent platform for learning Linux system administration fundamentals."
    3. The basic differences between Rocky and Debian.
      "The main differences lie in their origins and package management. Rocky Linux is derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source code, 
      aiming for binary compatibility with RHEL. It uses the RPM package format and the dnf package manager. Debian is an independent, 
      community-driven project and the base for many other distributions like Ubuntu. It uses the DEB package format and the apt family of package 
      managers (apt, apt-get, aptitude). They also have different philosophies regarding software inclusion and release cycles."
    4. The benefits of virtual machines.
      "Virtual machines offer several key benefits:
        Isolation: They provide a sandboxed environment, separating the guest OS from the host. This is great for testing software or configurations 
        without risking the host system.
        Resource Consolidation: Multiple VMs can run on a single physical machine, making efficient use of hardware resources.
        Snapshots: You can save the state of a VM at any point (a snapshot) and easily revert to it if something goes wrong, which is invaluable for 
        experimentation.
        Testing & Development: VMs allow easy creation of specific, reproducible environments for development or testing software across different OS 
        versions or configurations.
        Portability: VM images can often be moved and run on different physical computers."
    5. If the chosen operating system is Rocky, they must explain what SELinux and DNF are.
      "SELinux, which stands for Security-Enhanced Linux, is a Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting Mandatory Access 
      Control (MAC) security policies. Unlike standard Linux Discretionary Access Control (DAC) which relies on user/group ownership and permissions 
      (like rwx), SELinux enforces rules based on policies that define what actions specific processes (subjects) can perform on specific system resources 
      (objects) like files, devices, or network ports. It works by assigning security labels to both subjects and objects. Even if standard file permissions 
      would allow an action, SELinux can block it if the policy doesn't explicitly permit it. This significantly enhances security by limiting the potential 
      damage from compromised processes, preventing privilege escalation, and enforcing fine-grained access control."
      "DNF (Dandified YUM) is the default high-level package manager for Rocky Linux and other modern RPM-based distributions like Fedora and RHEL 8+. It's 
      the successor to yum. DNF is used to install, update, remove, and otherwise manage software packages (in .rpm format) on the system. It automatically 
      handles dependencies, meaning when you install a package, DNF ensures all other required packages are also installed. Compared to yum, DNF offers 
      improved performance, better dependency resolution using the libsolv library, and a more predictable command-line interface."
    6. If the chosen operating system is Debian, they must explain the difference between aptitude and apt, and what APPArmor is. 
      "Both apt and aptitude are high-level package management tools for Debian systems, acting as front-ends to the lower-level dpkg tool.
      apt is the more modern and commonly used command-line interface. It provides essential commands like install, remove, update, upgrade in a 
      straightforward manner.
      aptitude offers both a command-line interface and an interactive text-based UI. Its main advantage is often considered its more sophisticated 
      dependency resolver. 
      When conflicts arise, aptitude can sometimes suggest multiple resolution strategies, whereas apt might be more direct. aptitude also keeps a slightly 
      more detailed log of which packages were installed automatically versus explicitly."
    7. During the defense, a script must display information every 10 minutes. Its operation will be checked in detail later.
      "I have created a monitoring script (monitoring.sh) located at /etc/cron.d/monitoring.sh. I have configured a cron job that executes this script every 
      10 minutes. The script's output, containing various system metrics, is broadcast to all logged-in user terminals using wall. We can check the script's 
      content and the crontab entry later in the evaluation."
  If the explanations are not clear, the evaluation stops here.

Simple Configuration

  As soon as you need help to verify a point, the evaluated person must be able to assist you:
    1. Verify that the machine does not have a graphical environment at startup. A password will be requested before any connection attempt on this machine. 
    Log in with a non-root user. Verify that the chosen password respects the rules imposed in the subject.
      Check User Password: (M1gusant42us3r)
        Your password must be at least 10 characters long. It must contain an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a number. Also, it must not contain 
        more than 3 consecutive identical characters. The password must not include the name of the user.
      Check User Password Extra Policies Command:
        Your password has to expire every 30 days. The minimum number of days allowed before the modification of a password will be set to 2. The user has 
        to receive a warning message 7 days before their password expires.
          sudo chage -l migusant
      Check Log in with Non-Root User Command:
        whoami
      Expected Output:
        migusant
      Check Default Target for System Boot Command:
        systemctl get-default
      Expected Output:
        If we get multi-user.target, it indicates the system boots into a command-line environment.
        If we get graphical.target, it indicates the system is configured to boot into a GUI login manager and desktop. If there is no GUI to boot to, it will boot to a command-line environment.
      Check Graphical Environment Command:
        dpkg -l | grep -E "xserver|gnome|kde|xfce|lxde"
        or
        ls /usr/bin | grep -E "startx|Xorg"
      Expected Output:
        If these commands return results, it means graphical packages are indeed installed.
    2. Then, with the help of the evaluator, make sure that:
      2.1 The chosen operating system is indeed Debian or Rocky.
        OS Command:
          cat /etc/os-release
        Expected Output:
          The output should contain lines clearly identifying the OS as "Debian".
      2.2 The UFW service is properly launched.
        UFW Status Command:
          systemctl status ufw
        Expected Output:
          Active: active (running)
      2.3 The SSH service is properly launched. 
        SSH Service Command:
          systemctl status sshd
        Expected Output:
          Active: active (running)
          Check the port to verify it's listening on the port specified in the subject (e.g., 4242) and not the default port 22.
  If something does not work as expected or is not clearly explained, the evaluation stops here.

User

  As soon as you need help to verify a point, the evaluated person must be able to assist you:
    1. The subject requires that a user with the login name of the evaluated person be present on the virtual machine. Verify that this user has been added 
    and that they belong to the "sudo" and "user42" groups.
      Check if Belongs Command:
        id migusant or groups migusant
      Expected Output:
        Look for migusant's UID/GID information and verify that both sudo and user42 are listed in the groups= section of the output.
    2. Ensure the rules imposed in the subject concerning the password policy have been implemented by following the steps below.
      2.1 First, create a new user. Assign them a password of your choice, respecting the subject's rules.
        Create user Command:
          sudo adduser testuser
        Create password Command:
          sudo passwd testuser
            If the policy is correctly implemented (e.g., via PAM modules like pam_pwquality), the system should:
              Reject passwords that don't have at lease 10 characters.
              Reject passwords that don't include at lease one uppercase.
              Reject passwords that don't include at lease one lowercase.
              Reject passwords that don't include at lease one digit.
              Reject passwords that include username.
            Eventually accept a password that does meet the criteria.
      2.2 The evaluated person must now explain how they were able to implement the requested rules on their virtual machine.
        "To implement the password policy, I needed to do two different things:
          Password Aging/Expiration: I edited the /etc/login.defs file. Specifically, I set parameters like PASS_MAX_DAYS (e.g., to 30 or 90, as required) 
          to force password changes, PASS_MIN_DAYS (e.g., to 2) to prevent immediate changes, and PASS_WARN_AGE (e.g., to 7) to warn users before expiration.
          Password Strength/Complexity: I installed the libpam-pwquality package (if not present) and configured it by editing the /etc/pam.d/common-password 
          file. I added or modified the line for pam_pwquality.so to include options specified in the subject, such as retry=3 (limit password attempts), 
          minlen=10 (minimum length), dcredit=-1 (at least one digit), ucredit=-1 (at least one uppercase), lcredit=-1 (at least one lowercase), ocredit=-1 
          (at least one special character), and potentially difok=7 (must differ from old password by 7 characters) and reject_username (prevent using username in password)."
  If there is any problem, the evaluation stops here.
    3. Now that you have a new user, ask the evaluated person to create a group named "evaluating" in front of you and assign it to this user.
