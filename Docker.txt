1. Connect to your VM

    Make sure you are connected to your Debian VM via SSH, as you configured earlier in the guide:
    ssh migusant@localhost -p 2222

    Then switch to the root user:
    su -
    Enter the root password when prompted.

2. Install Docker

Docker provides an official installation script and packages for Debian. Follow these steps:

    Update your package list:
    apt update

    Install prerequisite packages: 
    apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release -y

    Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key: 
    mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

    Set up the Docker repository: 
    echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
    $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

    Update the package list again (to include Docker packages): 
    apt update

    Install Docker Engine, CLI, and Containerd: 
    apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin -y

3. Test Docker Installation

    To verify that Docker is installed and running correctly, run the standard hello-world container:
    docker run hello-world

    You should see output similar to this, indicating that Docker pulled the image and ran the container successfully:
    Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
    latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
    [...]
    Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    [...]

4. Add Your User to the docker Group (Optional but Recommended)

    To run Docker commands as your regular user (without sudo), add your user to the docker group:
    usermod -aG docker your_username # Replace your_username with your actual login

    You'll need to log out and log back in (or if you don't want to logout run newgrp docker) for this change to take effect.
